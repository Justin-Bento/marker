          Projects get paused. Plans change. Life interrupts. When you return,
          it’s hard to remember your steps or your purpose—and most project
          tools don’t make that any easier. This tracker helps you rebuild focus
          and get back on track effortlessly.

        <h2>A Master Document That Works With You</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional project trackers assume you already have all the details.
          This one doesn’t. It guides you step-by-step, helping you think,
          write, and shape your project as it develops..

        <p>
          At its core, this is a simple Word document. The structure is there to
          support you, but you are the planner who brings the project to life. I
          built this website to show how even one small idea can grow into
          something bigger—just like the site you’re on right now..
